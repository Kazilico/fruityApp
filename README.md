# fruityApp

fruityApp is my pet project, designed to be simple, but expandable, for the purpose of determining whether or not a fruit is currently in season. As a baker, knowing what fruit is at peak freshness at any paricular moment is a nice thing. In its current iteration, there are a preloaded number of fruits and the fruits that are currently in season are highlighted. Eventualy, I intend to add the ability to add any fruit onto the page.
